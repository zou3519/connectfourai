Connect Four with Minimax AI
=============
By Richard Zou
Work dated January 2012, added to GitHub November 2014.

Introduction
-------------
A simple command line Connect Four game. Has a minimax AI that uses an alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
The project was initially done in Netbeans and has currently been ported to IntelliJ IDEA. Runs in Java >= 1.6.

Play against an applet
------------------
Click on the link below to play against a Java applet (with GUI!) of this game.  
The Java applet was developed in Greenfoot, which is a simple Java IDE that provides
easy access to graphics and a good learning experience.

Press start to run the game.  The game does not tell you when it ends; you will not be able to make another move
if you lose or win.  This was coded in 2012 so I have lost track of the Greenfoot source code and cannot
modify it.
